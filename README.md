# Restaurant website

- Approx. completion time: **10 hours**
- Deliverables: **1 HTML file, 1 CSS file, images**

---

**This is a cumulative website project, with the goal of proving to me that you can do everything learned this term—by yourself.**

- *Fork this repository.*
- Create an interative wireframe/prototype for the restaurant website you planned and designed in Jed’s class.
- *It should have real text content.*
- Greys can be used for everything if you’d like. If you choose to use colours make sure they’re nicely designed and consistent.
- Placeholder images are good—there’s a bunch of different sizes and shapes in the “images” folder.
- **Hand in all the milestones & deliverables listed below.**
- **Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.**

---

## Markbot will expect

- `header`, `header nav`, `header h1`, `header li`, `header nav a`
- `main`, `h2`, `div`, `section`, `img`, `footer`
- A Google Font
- CSS boilerplate: `cssviewport`, `borderbox`, `textsize`
- Standard media query widths: `25em`, `38em`, `60em`, `90em`
- Standard text sizes & line heights: `100%/1.3`, `110%/1.4`, `120%/1.5`, `130%/1.5`
- `margin`, `padding`, `position: absolute`, `position: relative`, `float: left` or `float: right`, `display: block`, `display: inline-block`
- A background-color hover state for the navigation links

**If your website looks exactly like this you’ll receive a 0.**

## Deliverables & milestones

### 1. Paper plan

*Due end of class week 13*

On paper, plan out the website’s primary boxes, semantics & CSS properties like we did in these activities:

- [Sketching a website](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/courses/web-dev-1/sketching-a-website)
- [Paper plans](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/courses/web-dev-1/paper-plans)

Also, denote what code exercises (or videos) from this term that are most relevant to the code you need to write for each chunk of the website. Like we did in this activity:

- [Finding patterns](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/courses/web-dev-1/finding-patterns/)

**Show the paper plan to Thomas by the end of class week 13. Late submissions or submissions not presented in person will not be accepted.**

### 2. Code milestone

*Due end of class week 14*

In class, during week 14 you must show Thomas progress on the coded version of your website. At this point the code should be far along.

**Show the working website to Thomas by the end of class week 14. Late submissions or submissions not presented in person will not be accepted.**

### 3. Browser testing

*Due end of class week 15*

In class, during week 15, we’ll be testing everybody’s website in different browsers to make sure they look good.

**When I’m grading the websites I’ll be using a random browser to view your site.**

### 4. Request for grade

*Due last day of the term, Friday at midnight*

Since the goal of this project is to prove to me that you can do everything learned this term I want a written statement denoting your proof—and a grade you think you deserve.

The written explanation should be a list of things we learned this term that you applied to your website. **Most importantly how and why your website proves you can do the things we learned this term.** Explain to me **why** you deserve the grade you chose for yourself.

- Give yourself a grade for the project: F, C, B, A, A+<br>
- Write an explanation as to why the website shows you’ve learned and can apply everything from the term.
- Be honest with yourself and with me (I’ll notice if you’re not)

**I will read your explanation while looking over your websites. If your feedback is honest and just, you will receive the mark you chose.**

[**Submit the explanation to the Restaurant website assignment on Canvas—there’s a text entry field.**](https://algonquin.instructure.com/courses/467502/assignments/4177680)

### 5. Final website

*Due last day of the term, Friday at midnight*

Drop this folder into your Markbot application. Make sure to fix all the errors. And submit to Canvas using Markbot.

**Markbot will give you 1/100—this is just a confirmation so you know that the URL was handed in properly—it is not your final mark.**
